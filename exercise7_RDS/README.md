# After exercise 5

We use a key pair generated by `ssh-keygen` instead of downloading from AWS.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/XXXXX/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/XXXXX/.ssh/edx_build_aws
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in edx_build_aws.
Your public key has been saved in edx_build_aws.pub.
...
```


Access to EC2 instance
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/edx_build_aws ec2-user@output-public-ip
```
